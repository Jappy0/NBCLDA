# NBCLDA
A Novel approach was propsed based on the Naïve Bayesian Classifier to predict potential LncRNA–Disease Associations. 

# Requirement
MATLAB R2016a or later

# Run NBCLDA
1. The processed data in this paper is provided in the file "data", please run the script "NBCLDA_INIT" directly to evaludate the performance of NBCLDA by using the framework of LOOCV.
2. "NBCLDA_GN2_SD" is the main function to infer potential associations between LncRNAs and Diseases. If you would like to perform this method with your own dataset, you need to process the data first.
